Semantics are integrated into the parser.
Here, the symbol table is checked and completed.
Syntax is essentially the encoding of the LL(1) grammar.
A non-terminal symbol is the name of a function, and the production(s)
constitute its body. If there is more than one production in a terminal symbol,
they are handled as a switch statement.
